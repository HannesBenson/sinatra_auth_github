{"name":"Sinatra auth github","body":"# Sinatra Auth GitHub\r\n\r\nWe :heart: [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) at GitHub for building small applications that do something well.  A lot of times we want to enable those apps to allow GitHubbers to login and see what we've built.  We use organizations and GitHub OAuth](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/) to make this happen.  This way we can ensure that our coworkers can see the data, but other random GitHub users.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* authenticate a user against GitHub's OAuth service\r\n* provide an easy way to make API requests for the authenticated user\r\n* optionally restrict users to a specific GitHub organization\r\n* optionally restrict users to a specific GitHub team\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n@atmos, @defunkt, and @sr.\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with it? Open [an issue](https://github.com/atmos/sinatra_auth_github/issues/new).\r\n","tagline":"simple sinatra extension to authenticate users against github oauth","google":""}
